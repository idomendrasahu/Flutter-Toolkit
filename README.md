# Flutter-Toolkit

Flutter is a toolkit for building apps, and the “tools” in this toolkit are widgets. In Flutter everything is a widget. Some of the basic and commonly used widgets are:
Text: The Text widget lets us create a run of styled text within our app.
Row, Column: These widgets let us create flexible layouts in both the horizontal (Row) and vertical (Column) directions.
Stack: The Stack widget lets us place widgets on top of each other in paint order. We can then use Positioned widget on children of a stack to position them relative top, right, bottom, or left edge of the stack.
Container: The Container widget lets us create a rectangular visual element. It can be decorated with BoxDecoration, such as a background, a border, or a shadow. It can also have margins, padding, and constraints applied to its size.
The apps are made using these basic widgets and more of such widgets. Even some of the widgets themselves are made up of widgets. For example, consider the AppBar widget which is the header bar for many apps. It is composed of other widgets such as Text, Icons, etc. So basically, a complete app in Flutter is nothing but a hierarchy of widgets!
At first, all of these concepts seem difficult like the complex rules of Chess. But as the time passes and you become familiar with the basic functionalities, you will start adoring the process and soon you will become the “Grandmaster” of app development.
Let us discuss other aspects of Flutter. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. 

Flutter Framework: The major components of Flutter include- 
•Language: Flutter apps are written in Dart Language. 
•Flutter Engine: The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting Flutter applications, which is primarily written in C++. 
• Foundation Library: It provides basic classes and functions that are used to construct applications using Flutter, it is primarily written in Dart. 
• Design-Specific Widgets: It contains two sets of widgets. The first implements Google's Design Language, and the second implements the iOS Human interface guidelines. 

Why do we adore Flutter? 
Flutter's features that let us rely on a single codebase and UI engine for cross-platform development make the task of creating versions of Android and iOS apps effortless. 
Flutter's widget library is fully packed with predefined functionality which reduces the overall coding time which is the most attractive trait of Flutter, as there is no such thing as "time" in the Developer's life. 
Some of our most loved apps such as Google Ads, Xianyu by Alibaba, Postmuse, KlasterMe, and many others are made using... Yes, you are right, all of them are made using Flutter. Despite being launched in 2017, Flutter has been used by 39% of developers from all across the world.
Summary:
To summarize, the basics steps involved in building an app using Flutter are:
Creating a Flutter app development grounds.
Writing Dart Codes.
Using an External or third-party library.
Using the hot reload feature for a faster development cycle.
Implementing a stateful widget.
Created an infinite scrolling list.
